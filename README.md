# Expo Camera API - Intermittent Preview Freezing

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo's Camera API, where the camera preview would freeze intermittently. The issue is non-deterministic, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

The camera preview freezes randomly, regardless of device orientation or other factors.  This is inconsistent, making the issue difficult to isolate and debug.

## Solution

A solution is provided (see `bugSolution.js`) that involves using a combination of `useAsyncEffect` from `react-async` and ensuring proper handling of lifecycle events within the `Camera` component, making sure that resources are properly released even when unexpected behaviors occur. This improved resource management helps prevent freezing.  Note that this is not a guaranteed fix for all cases, as the original bug is non-deterministic.
