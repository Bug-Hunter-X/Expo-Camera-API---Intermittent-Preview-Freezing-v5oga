While using Expo's `Camera` API, I encountered an issue where the camera preview would freeze intermittently. This would occur randomly, regardless of device orientation or other factors.  The issue wasn't consistent, making it difficult to debug. I tried various solutions, including clearing the cache, reinstalling Expo Go and libraries, and checking for conflicting packages, but nothing seemed to resolve the issue.
